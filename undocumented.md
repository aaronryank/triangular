Here are some features I don't like, but make the language easier to use:

## Extra IP switches

    j conditionally (if ToS > 0) switch to NW
    k conditionally switch to direction N
    y conditionally switch to direction NE
    n conditionally switch to direction E
    q conditionally switch to direction SE
    r conditionally switch to direction S
    t conditionally switch to direction SW
    w conditionally switch to direction W
